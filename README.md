# Anim Reflect
AnimReflect (formerly known as MirrorAnimationSystem) is a plugin for Unreal Engine that allows for dynamic animation reversal. This plugin is based on the original MirrorAnimationSystem project created by Rexocrates.

AnimReflect incorporates functionalities that enable mirroring animations with their root motion at runtime, both within the editor and during gameplay.

The project has been renamed and updated to provide an enhanced and more intuitive experience. Credits and acknowledgments to Rexocrates for their work on the original MirrorAnimationSystem are crucial. This repository is a fork of the original project, with additional modifications and improvements made by NachoideV2.
